# Custom Models GitHub Action

> **Note**: This repository is still a work in progress

The custom models action manages custom inference models and their associated deployments in DataRobot via GitHub CI/CD workflows. 
These workflows allow you to create or delete models and deployments and modify settings. Metadata defined in 
YAML files enables the custom model action's control over models and deployments. Most YAML files for this action 
can reside in any folder within your custom model's repository. The YAML is searched, collected, and tested against 
a schema to determine if it contains the entities used in these workflows.

## Prerequisite
The following feature flags must be enabled in DataRobot:
* ENABLE_MLOPS
* ENABLE_CUSTOM_INFERENCE_MODEL
* ENABLE_CUSTOM_MODEL_GITHUB_CI_CD

The following feature flag is optional, for extended information:
* EXPERIMENTAL_API_ACCESS

(Please contact [DataRobot support](mailto:support@datarobot.com) for more information)

## Custom Model Action Quick Start

This quickstart example uses a [Python Scikit-Learn model template](https://github.com/datarobot/datarobot-user-models/tree/master/model_templates/python3_sklearn) 
from the [datarobot-user-model repository](https://github.com/datarobot/datarobot-user-models/tree/master/model_templates). 
To set up a custom models action that will create a custom inference model and deployment in DataRobot from a custom model 
repository in GitHub, take the following steps:

1. In the `.github/workflows` directory of your custom model repository, create a YAML file (with any filename) 
   containing the following:

    ```yaml
    name: Workflow CI/CD

    on:
      pull_request:
        branches: [ master ]
      push:
        branches: [ master ]

      # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
      workflow_dispatch:

    jobs:
      datarobot-custom-models:
        # Run this job on any action of a PR, but skip the job upon merging to the main branch. This
        # will be taken care of by the push event.
        if: ${{ github.event.pull_request.merged != true }}

        runs-on: ubuntu-latest

        steps:
          - uses: actions/checkout@v3
            with:
              fetch-depth: 0

              - name: DataRobot Custom Models Step
                id: datarobot-custom-models-step
                uses: datarobot-oss/custom-models-action@v1.1.6
                with:
                  api-token: ${{ secrets.DATAROBOT_API_TOKEN }}
                  webserver: https://app.datarobot.com/
                  branch: master
                  allow-model-deletion: true
                  allow-deployment-deletion: true
    ```
    
    Configure the following fields:

    - `branches`: Provide the name of your repository's main branch (usually either `master` or `main`) for `pull_request` and `push`. 
      If you created your repository in GitHub, you likely need to update these fields to `main`. 
      While `master` and `main` are the most common branch names, you can target any branch; 
      for example, you could run the workflow on a `release` branch or a `test` branch.

    - `api-token`: Provide a value for the `${{ secrets.DATAROBOT_API_TOKEN }}` variable by creating an 
      [encrypted secret for GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository)
      containing your [DataRobot API key](https://docs.datarobot.com/en/docs/platform/account-mgmt/acct-settings/api-key-mgmt.html#api-key-management).
      Alternatively, you can set the token string directly to this field; however, this method is
      highly discouraged because your API key is extremely sensitive data. If you use this method, 
      anyone with access to your repository can access your API key.

    - `webserver`: Provide your DataRobot webserver value here if it isn't the default DataRobot 
      US server (`https://app.datarobot.com/`).

    - `branch`: Provide the name of your repository's main branch (usually either `master` or `main`). 
      If you created your repository in GitHub, you likely need to update this field to `main`. 
      While `master` and `main` are the most common branch names, you can target any branch; 
      for example, you could run the workflow on a `release` branch or a `test` branch.

2. Commit the workflow YAML file and push it to the remote. After you complete this step, any
   push to the remote (or merged pull request) triggers the action.

3. In the folder for your DataRobot custom model, add a model definition YAML file (e.g., `model.yaml`)
   containing the following YAML and update the field values according to your model's characteristics:

    ```yaml
    user_provided_model_id: company/user/model-unique-id-1
    target_type: Regression
    settings:
      name: My Awesome GitHub Model 1 [GitHub CI/CD]
      target_name: Grade 2014

    version:
      # Make sure this is the environment ID is in your system.
      # This one is the '[DataRobot] Python 3 Scikit-Learn Drop-In' environment
      model_environment_id: 5e8c889607389fe0f466c72d
    ```
    Configure the following fields:

    - `user_provided_model_id`: Provide any descriptive and unique string value. The value must be
      globally unique. A good practice is to use this pattern: `<company>/<user>/<model-unique-id>`.
    - `target_type`: Provide the correct target type for your custom model.
    - `target_name`: Provide the correct target name for your custom model.
    - `model_environment_id`: Provide the DataRobot execution environment required for your custom model.
      You can find these environments in the DataRobot application under 
      [**Model Registry** > **Custom Model Workshop** > **Environments**](https://docs.datarobot.com/en/docs/mlops/deployment/custom-models/custom-env.html).

4. In any directory in your repository, add a deployment definition YAML file (with any filename) 
   containing the following YAML:

    ```yaml
    user_provided_deployment_id: company/user/my-awesome-deployment-id
    user_provided_model_id: company/user/model-unique-id-1
    ```

    Configure the following fields:

    - `user_provided_deployment_id`: Provide any descriptive and unique string value. The value
      must be globally unique. A good practice is to use this pattern:
      `<company>/<user>/<deployment-unique-id>`.
    - `user_provided_model_id`: Provide the exact `user_provided_model_id` you set in the model
      definition YAML file.

5. Commit these changes and push to the remote:

    - Navigate to your custom model repository in GitHub and click the `Actions` tab. You'll notice
      that the action is being executed.

    - Navigate to the DataRobot application. You'll notice that a new custom model was
      created along with an associated deployment. This action can take a few minutes.

> **Note**: Creating two commits (or merging two pull requests) in quick succession can result in a `ResourceNotFoundError`. 
> For example, you add a model definition with a training dataset, make a commit, and push to the remote. 
> Then, you immediately delete the model definition, make a commit, and push to the remote.
> The training data upload action may begin after model deletion, resulting in an error.
> To avoid this scenario, wait for an action's execution to complete before pushing new commits or merging new pull requests to the remote repository.

## Custom Model Action Commit Information in DataRobot

After your workflow creates a model and a deployment in DataRobot, you can access the commit information 
from the model's version info and the deployment's overview:

### Model Version Info

1. In the **Model Registry**, click **Custom Model Workshop**.

2. On the **Models** tab, click a GitHub-sourced model from the list and then click the **Versions** tab.

3. Under **Manage Versions**, click the version you want to view the commit for.

4. Under **Version Info**, find the **Git Commit Reference** and then click the commit hash (or commit ID) 
   to open the commit in GitHub that created the current version.

### Model Package Info

  1. In the **Model Registry**, click **Model Packages**.
  
  2. On the **Model Packages** tab, click a GitHub-sourced model package from the list.

  2. Under **Package Info**, review the model information provided by your workflow, find the **Git Commit Reference**, 
     and then click the commit hash (or commit ID) to open the commit that created the current model package. 

### Deployment overview

1. In the **Deployments** inventory, click a GitHub-sourced deployment from the list.

2. On the deployment's **Overview** tab, review the model and deployment information provided by your workflow.

3. In the **Content** group box, find the **Git Commit Reference** and click the commit hash (or commit ID) 
   to open the commit that created the deployment.

## Custom Model Action Reference

### Datasets

Datasets referenced in custom models action YAML files are expected to exist in the DataRobot AI catalog 
before configuring the action in GitHub. You should upload these datasets to the DataRobot 
AI catalog (via the UI or any other client) prior to configuring the GitHub action.

### Drop-In Environments

Environments referenced in custom models action YAML files are expected to exist in DataRobot before 
configuring the action in GitHub. You should validate the existence of the required drop-in environments 
prior to configuring the GitHub action. In addition, you can install new drop-in environments. 
For more information, see the [Custom model environments documentation](https://docs.datarobot.com/en/docs/mlops/deployment/custom-models/custom-env.html).

### The GitHub Action's Input Arguments <a id="input-arguments"/>

### Model Definition

The GitHub action requires the model's metadata in a YAML file. The model's full schema is defined in
[this source code block](
https://github.com/datarobot/custom-models-action/blob/62b9df9e8895becabd7592e65c0ed52252690498/src/schema_validator.py#L271
)

A model metadata YAML file may contain the schema of a single model's definition (as specified above)
or the schema of multiple models' definitions.

The **multiple models' schema** is defined in [this source code block](
https://github.com/datarobot/custom-models-action/blob/62b9df9e8895becabd7592e65c0ed52252690498/src/schema_validator.py#L351
).

The single model's definition YAML file must be located inside the model's root directory.
The multiple models' definition YAML file can be located anywhere in the repository.

For examples, please refer to the [model definition examples section](#model-examples) below.

<details><summary>Notes</summary>

* A model is first created during a pull request whenever a new definition is detected.
* A model is deleted during a merge to the main branch if the associated model's definition 
  is missing. This can happen if the model definition's YAML file is deleted or if the model's 
  unique ID is changed.
* Changes to the models in DataRobot are made during a pull request to the configured main
  branch. These include changes to settings as well as the creation of new custom inference model
  versions.
* A new model version is created upon changes to the model's code or the fields under the `version`
  section.

</details>

#### Model Definition Sections

At the top level, there are attributes you cannot change after a model is created:

* `settings`: Changes to the fields under this section result in changes to the model's
              settings without creating a new version.
* `version`: Changes to the fields under this section result in a new version.
* `test`: Contains attributes that control the custom inference model testing. If omitted, a
          test will not be executed.

### Deployment Definition

The user is required to provide the deployment's metadata in a YAML file. The deployment's full
schema is defined in [this source code block](
https://github.com/datarobot/custom-models-action/blob/62b9df9e8895becabd7592e65c0ed52252690498/src/schema_validator.py#L639
).

A deployment metadata YAML file may contain the schema of a single deployment's definition (as
specified above) or the schema of multiple deployments' definitions.

The **multiple deployments' schema** is defined in [this source code block](
https://github.com/datarobot/custom-models-action/blob/62b9df9e8895becabd7592e65c0ed52252690498/src/schema_validator.py#L679
).

The deployment definition YAML file (single or multiple) can be located anywhere in
the repository.

For examples, please refer to the [deployment definition examples section](#deployment-examples)
below.

<details><summary>Notes</summary>

 * Changes to deployments in DataRobot are made upon making a commit or merging a pull request
   to the configured main branch. During a pull request, the GitHub action only performs
   integrity checks.
 * Every new version of the associated custom inference model will result in a new challenger
   or a model's replacement in the deployment. It depends on the deployment's configuration, which
   can be controlled from the YAML file. The default is the creation of a new challenger.

</details>

#### Deployment Definition Sections

At the top level, some attributes shouldn't be changed once the deployment is created: 

* `user_provided_model_id`: An exception that associates a model definition to the given deployment. 
  A change in this field triggers model replacement or challenger creation, depending on the deployment's configuration.
* `settings`: Changes to the fields in this section will result in changes to the deployment's settings.

### GitHub Workflow

A GitHub workflow is a configurable process of one or more jobs. It is defined in a YAML
file located under `.github/workflows` in the repository. For more information, refer to
[Using Workflows in GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows).

To use the Custom Models Action, the following YAML should be included in the 
GitHub workflow definition:

1. The action should run on two events: `pull_request` and `push`. Therefore, the
   following should be defined:

    ```yaml
    on:
      pull_request:
        branches: [ master ]
      push:
        branches: [ master ]
    ```
2. Use the DataRobot custom models action in a workflow job as follows:

    ```yaml
    jobs:
      datarobot-custom-models:
        # Run this job on any action of a PR, but skip the job upon merging to the main branch.
        # This will be taken care of by the push event.
        if: ${{ github.event.pull_request.merged != true }}

          runs-on: ubuntu-latest

          steps:
            - uses: actions/checkout@v3
              with:
                fetch-depth: 0

          - name: DataRobot Custom Models Step
            id: datarobot-custom-models-step
            uses: datarobot-oss/custom-models-action@v1.1.6
            with:
              api-token: ${{ secrets.DATAROBOT_API_TOKEN }}
              webserver: ${{ secrets.DATAROBOT_WEBSERVER }}
              branch: master
              allow-model-deletion: true
              allow-deployment-deletion: true
    ```
  <details><summary>Notes</summary>

  - `if: ${{ github.event.pull_request.merged != true }}`: An important condition that is
    needed in order to skip the action's execution upon merging. The action will be triggered
    by the 'push' event.
  - `actions/checkout@v3`: The action scans the repository files; therefore, it requires the checkout
    action a step before the DataRobot action.
  - `custom-models-action@1.1.4`: This link refers to a specific historic release. You might want
    to look at newer versions in the [RELEASES.md](RELEASES.md).
  - Two input arguments are used to establish communication with DataRobot. 
    These arguments should be defined in the repository **Secrets** section:
    - `DATAROBOT_API_TOKEN`: The API token used to validate credentials with DataRobot.
    - `DATAROBOT_WEBSERVER`: The publicly accessible DataRobot web server URL.
      For the full possible input arguments to the action, refer to the [input arguments section](#input-arguments) above.

  </details>

  For a complete example, refer to the [workflow example](#workflow-example) below.

### Development Information

#### The Repository Structure

The top-level files and directories include the following:

* `action.yaml`: The YAML file containing the definition of the DataRobot custom models GitHub action.
* `.github`: The directory containing a GitHub workflow that executes the following jobs:
    * Linter 
    * Code style checks
    * Unit-tests
    * Functional tests
* `deps`: The directory containing Python requirements for the development of this repository.
* `src`: The directory containing the source code that implements the related GitHub actions.
* `tests`: The directory containing the code source and resources to test the implementation. 
  It includes the following:
    * `datasets`: The directory containing datasets used by the tests.
    * `deployments`: The directory containing a deployment definition that is used by tests.
    * `functional`: The directory containing the functional tests' source code.
    * `models`: The directory containing the model definition and source code used by the tests.
    * `unit`: The directory containing the unit-test source code.

#### Functional Tests

Functional tests are written on top of the main entry point, simulating the GitHub actions execution. 
To enable communication with DataRobot, you must set two important environment variables:

  * `DATAROBOT_WEBSERVER`: The DataRobot web server URL, which can be accessed publicly.
  * `DATAROBOT_API_TOKEN`: The API key used to validate credentials with the DataRobot system.

In the current repository, there is a definition of one model under `tests/models/py3_sklearn/`
and one deployment under `tests/deployments` used by the functional test.

#### Development Workflow

Changes in this repository should be submitted as pull requests. When a pull request is
created, the associated GitHub workflow is triggered, and the following jobs are executed
sequentially:

* Linter
* Code style checks
* Unit-tests.
* Functional test(s).

> **Note**: To enable the full execution of the functional test, the two related
> variables (`DATAROBOT_WEBSERVER` and `DATAROBOT_API_TOKEN`) were set in the
> **Secrets** section of the GitHub repository. These are read by the workflow, which 
> sets the proper environment variables.

#### GitHub Workflow Example <a id="workflow-example"/>

This is an example of a GitHub workflow definition. The YAML file should be located 
at the following location: `.github/workflows/workflow.yaml`. 

The YAML file should contain the following:

```yaml
name: Workflow CI/CD

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ]
  push:
    branches: [ master ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  datarobot-custom-models:
    # Run this job on any action of a PR, but skip the job upon merging to the main branch. This
    # will be taken care of by the push event.
    if: ${{ github.event.pull_request.merged != true }}

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

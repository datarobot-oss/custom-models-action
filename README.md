# Custom Models GitHub Action

(**NOTE: this repository is still a work in progress**)

This repository contains the DataRobot GitHub action to manage Datarobot custom inference models
and deployments via CI/CD GitHub workflows. It enables users to create/delete and change settings of
models and deployments.

The control over models and deployments are done via metadata YAML files, which in general, can be
located at any folder under the repository. The YAML files are searched, collected and tested
against a specific schema to identify whether they contain the related definitions for each of these
entities.

## Datasets
Datasets that are referenced in this definition YAML files are expected to exist in DataRobot
catalogue before doing any GitHub step. The user is required to upload these datasets
upfront, to the DataRobot catalog via its UI or any other client.

## Drop-In Environments
Environments that are referenced in this definition YAML files are expected to exist in DataRobot
Custom Models environments, before doing any GitHub action. The user is required to validate
the existence of such drop-in environments upfront and use any ID of these environments. The user
can also install a new drop-in environment and use its ID. For more information please reference
DataRobot documentation.

## The GitHub Action's Input Arguments <a id="input-arguments"/>
The GitHub action is implemented as a Python program, which is being called with specific arguments
that are provided by the user, in the GitHub workflow.

### Mandatory Input Arguments
The action supports the following mandatory input arguments:

* `--api-token` - DataRobot public API authentication token.
* `--branch` - the branch against which the program will function.
* `--webserver` - DataRobot Web server URL.

### Optional Input Arguments
The action supports the following optional input arguments:

* `--allow-deployment-deletion` - whether to detect local deleted deployment definitions and
     consequently delete them in DataRobot (Default: false).
* `--allow-model-deletion` - whether to detect local deleted model definitions and consequently
     delete them in DataRobot (Default: false).
* `--models-only` - determines whether to manage custom inference models only or also deployments
     (Default: false).
* `--skip-cert-verification` - whether a request to an HTTPS URL will be made without a certificate
     verification (Default: false).

## The GitHub Action's Output Statistics
The GitHub action supports the following output arguments, which can be later used by follow-up
steps in the same GitHub job (refer to the workflow example blow):

* `total-affected-models` - the total number of models that were affected by this action.
* `total-created-models` - the total number of new models that were created by this action.
* `total-deleted-models` - the total number of models that were deleted by this action.
* `total-created-model-versions` - the total number of new model versions that were created by
   this action.
* `total-affected-deployments` - the total number of deployments that were affected by this action.
* `total-created-deployments` - the total number of new deployments that were created by this action.
* `total-deleted-deployments` - the total number of deployments that were deleted by this action.
* `message` - the output message from the GitHub action.

## Model Definition
The user is required to provide the model's metadata in a YAML file. The model's full schema is
defined in
[this source code block](
https://github.com/datarobot/custom-models-action/blob/62b9df9e8895becabd7592e65c0ed52252690498/src/schema_validator.py#L271
)

A model metadata YAML file may contain a schema of a single model's definition (as specified above),
or a schema of multiple models' definition.

The **multiple models' schema** is defined [here](
https://github.com/datarobot/custom-models-action/blob/62b9df9e8895becabd7592e65c0ed52252690498/src/schema_validator.py#L351
).

The single model's definition YAML file is required to be located inside the model's root directory.
The multiple models' definition YAML file can be located anywhere in the repository.

For examples please refer to the [model definition examples section](#model-examples) below.

**Notes:**
* A model is first created during a pull request, whenever a new definition is detected.
* A model is actually deleted during merging to the main branch, upon missing of the associated
  model's definition. This can happen if the definition's YAML file was deleted or the user
  changed its unique ID.
* Changes to the models in DataRobot are done during a pull request to the configured main
  branch. These include changes to settings as well as to creation of new custom inference model
  versions.
* A new model version is created upon changes to the model's code or the fields under the `version`
  section.

### Model Definition Sections

* At the top level, there are attributes which cannot be changed once the model is created.
* `settings` - changes to the fields under this section will result in changes to the model's
               settings, without creation of a new version.
* `version` - changes to the fields under this section will result in creation of a new version.
* `test` - contains attributes that control the custom inference model testing. If omitted, a
           test will not be executed.

## Deployment Definition
The user is required to provide the deployment's metadata in a YAML file. The deployment's full
schema is defined in [this source code block](
https://github.com/datarobot/custom-models-action/blob/62b9df9e8895becabd7592e65c0ed52252690498/src/schema_validator.py#L639
).

A deployment metadata YAML file may contain a schema of a single deployment's definition (as
specified above), or a schema of multiple deployments' definition.

The **multiple deployments' schema** is defined [here](
https://github.com/datarobot/custom-models-action/blob/62b9df9e8895becabd7592e65c0ed52252690498/src/schema_validator.py#L679
).

The deployment's definition YAML file (either a single or multiple) can be located anywhere in
the repository.

For examples please refer to the [deployment definition examples section](#deployment-examples)
below.

**Notes:**:
 * Changes to deployments in DataRobot are done only upon merging a pull request
   to the configured main branch. During a pull request, the GitHub action only performs
   integrity checks.
 * Every new version of the associated custom inference model will result in a new challenger
   or a model's replacement in the deployment. It depends on the deployment's configuration, which
   can be controlled from the YAML file. The default is creation of a new challenger.

### Deployment Definition Sections

* At the top level, there are attributes which are not supposed to be changed once the
  deployment is created. An exceptional is the `user_provided_model_id` field, which associates
  a model definition to the given deployment. A change in this field will trigger a model
  replacement or challenger, depending on the deployment's configuration.
* `settings` - changes to the fields under this section will result in changes to the deployment's
               settings.

## GitHub Workflow
A GitHub workflow is a configurable process made up of one or more jobs. It is defined in a YAML
file, which is supposed to be located under `.github/workflows` in the repository
(for more information please refer to
  [Using Workflows in GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows)
)

In order to successfully use the DataRobot custom models GitHub action the following should be
embedded in the GitHub workflow definition:

1. The action should be run upon two events: `pull_request` and `push`. Therefore, the
   following should be set::
        ```yaml
        on:
          pull_request:
            branches: [ master ]
          push:
            branches: [ master ]
        ```
2. Use the DataRobot custom models action in a workflow job as follows:

```yaml
    jobs:
        datarobot-custom-models-action:
            # Run this job on any action of a PR, but skip the job upon merging to the main branch.
            # This will be taken care of by the push event.
            if: ${{ github.event.pull_request.merged != true }}

            runs-on: ubuntu-latest

            steps:
              - uses: actions/checkout@v3
                with:
                  fetch-depth: 0

              - name: DataRobot Custom Models Action
                id: datarobot-custom-models-action
                uses: datarobot/custom-models-action@v1.0.0
                with:
                  api-token: ${{ secrets.DATAROBOT_API_TOKEN }}
                  webserver: ${{ secrets.DATAROBOT_WEBSERVER }}
                  branch: master
                  allow-model-deletion: true
                  allow-deployment-deletion: true
```
   **Notes:**
   - `if: ${{ github.event.pull_request.merged != true }}` - this is an important condition that is
     needed in order to skip the action's execution upon merging. The action will be triggered
     by the 'push' event.
   - The action scans the repository files therefore it is required to use the `actions/checkout@v3`
     action in a step before DataRobot action.
   - There are two actions' input arguments that are used to establish a communication with
     DataRobot system. They should reside in the repository "Secrets" section:
     - `DATAROBOT_API_TOKEN` - the API token that is used to validate credentials with DataRobot
                               system.
     - `DATAROBOT_WEBSERVER` - the DataRobot web server URL, which can be accessed publicly.
   - For the full possible input arguments to the action please refer to the
     [input arguments section](#input-arguments) above.
   - For a complete example please refer to the [workflow example](#workflow-example) below.

## Development Information

### The Repository Structure
The top level folders include the following:
* `action.yaml` - the definition of the DataRobot custom models GitHub action.
* `.github` - contains a GitHub workflow that executes the following jobs:
    * A linter and code style check.
    * An execution of the unit-tests.
    * An execution of the functional tests.
* `deps` - contains Python requirements for development of this repository.
* `src` - contains the source code that implements the related GitHub actions.
* `tests` - contains code source and resources to test the implementation. It includes the
  following:
    * `datasets` - the datasets that are used by the tests.
    * `deployments` - contains a deployment definition that is used by tests.
    * `functional` - contains the functional tests source code.
    * `models` - contains a model definition and source code, which are used by the
                 tests.
    * `unit` - contains the unit-tests source code.

### Functional Tests
- The functional tests are written on top of the main entry point, thus simulating the GitHub
  actions execution. In order to enable communication with a real DataRobot system, there should
  be two environment variables that are expected to be set:

  * `DATAROBOT_WEBSERVER` - the DataRobot web server URL, which can be accessed publicly.
  * `DATAROBOT_API_TOKEN` - the API token that is used to validate credentials with DataRobot system.

- In the current repository there is a definition of one model under `tests/models/py3_sklearn/`,
  and one deployment under `tests/deployments`, which are used by the functional test.

### Development Workflow
Changes in this repository should be submitted as a pull requests. When a pull request is
created the associated GitHub workflow will be triggered and the following jobs will be executed
sequentially:
* A linter and code style.
* Execution of the unit-tests.
* Execution of a single functional test

**Note:** in order to enable the full execution of the functional test, the two related
variables (`DATAROBOT_WEBSERVER` & `DATAROBOT_API_TOKEN`) should be set in the
"Secrets" section in the GitHub repository. These are read by the workflow, which sets
the proper environment variables.
